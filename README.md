# C Visualizer [ Web ]

(example image should go here lol)

This is a web based visualizer for C programs.

What will it visualize ?

Essentially we're looking to do the following things

- Host an editor to enter code
- Step by step interpretation
- Stdout and stdin support
- Memory visualizer for stack and heap
  - Type specific output
  - Pointer visualizations
- Human friendly assembly output for each line
